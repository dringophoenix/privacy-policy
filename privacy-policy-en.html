    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <div class="info">
        <p>Updated: December 4, 2025</p>
        <p>Effective: December 4, 2025</p>
        <p>Application Name: Fireside Tracker</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Thank you for using our application. We highly value user privacy and data security. Please read the following content carefully.</p>
    
    <h2>I. Information Collection</h2>
    <p>Our application collects your battle data, including but not limited to deck information and hero classes during battles. By default, the system will upload this battle data, but we respect your right to choose. You can click on the user module, then click on either the User Agreement or Privacy Policy at the bottom, and modify settings in the top section of the details page. If you are logged in and allow data uploads, this data will be associated with your account; if you are not logged in or choose anonymous upload, the data will be collected anonymously and will not be associated with any specific account.</p>
    
    <h2>II. Battle Replay Videos</h2>
    <p>To help you review your battle process, Fireside Tracker will generate and save battle replay videos locally with your authorization. These videos are recordings of your device screen during battles and may include game footage as well as other information that appeared on the screen at that time (such as system notifications, chat content, account information, etc.).</p>
    <p>These videos are only saved in the local data of this application and will not be automatically saved to the system album or uploaded to any server by us. We will not collect, upload, or view the above battle replay video content without your active operation. When you choose to actively share or upload these videos through the system sharing function or third-party services (such as social platforms, cloud storage, etc.), the corresponding content will be processed by that third party according to its privacy policy, and you should understand and agree to the relevant rules yourself.</p>
    
    <h2>III. Data Upload Control and Impact</h2>
    <h3>Benefits of Data Upload</h3>
    <p>Data upload is enabled by default, which brings the following benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provides more accurate game environment data and statistics</li>
        <li>Allows your battle records to be synchronized to the cloud (if you are logged in)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Impact of Disabling Data Upload</h3>
    <p>Please note that if you choose to disable data upload:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The environment data you see may not be as accurate</li>
        <li>Even if you are logged in, your battle statistics cannot be synchronized to the cloud</li>
        <li>The system will not save your battle records locally</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can change your choice at any time using the method described above, and we will not restrict your use of other basic functions of the application if you turn off data uploads.</p>
    
    <h2>IV. Data Usage</h2>
    <p>The battle data we collect will be used to improve application functionality, optimize user experience, analyze gaming trends, and provide more accurate environment information services. Your battle data may be used for statistical analysis and application performance optimization, but will not be used for targeted advertising or sold to third parties.</p>
    
    <h2>V. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <h3>Data Storage</h3>
    <p>We take reasonable security measures to protect your battle data. We use industry-standard encryption technology to transmit and store this data. Battle data associated with accounts will be retained during the active period of your account; anonymously collected battle data will be kept for no more than 12 months, after which it will be completely anonymized or securely deleted.</p>
    
    <h3>Account Deletion and Data Removal</h3>
    <p>We provide an account deletion function. When you choose to delete your account, we will clear all personal data and battle data associated with your account. Please note that anonymously collected battle data (i.e., data generated when you use the deck tracking function while not logged in) will not be affected by account deletion. This data will continue to be used for application function optimization but will be automatically deleted or anonymized after the retention period mentioned above.</p>
    
    <h2>VI. Security Measures</h2>
    <p>We value user information security and take necessary security measures to protect the normal operation of the application, the security of users' devices, and the security of collected data. Our security measures include data transmission encryption, data storage encryption, and strict internal access controls.</p>
    
    <h2>VII. Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
    <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will provide notification in the application and update this page.</p>
    
    <h2>VIII. Contact Us</h2>
